    <!--What I hope to accomplish during IS 413-->
    <p>
        I hope to become more comfortable with programming in this class.
        I am excited to learn a more strongly typed language. I feel like I have the basics of programming
        down, but whenever we get to the more logic heavy aspects I sometimes struggle. So I look forward
        to getting more practice this semester!
